/**
 * A long-lived session; this can be used to automatically persist cookies from one request to the
 * next, or to set default configuration that will be shared between requests. These configuration
 * flags can all be over-ridden by the parameters on [[Requester.apply]] or [[Requester.stream]]
 *
 * @param auth
 *   HTTP authentication you want to use with this request; defaults to none
 * @param headers
 *   Custom headers to use, in addition to the defaults
 * @param readTimeout
 *   How long to wait for data to be read before timing out
 * @param connectTimeout
 *   How long to wait for a connection before timing out
 * @param proxy
 *   Host and port of a proxy you want to use
 * @param cookies
 *   Custom cookies to send up with this request
 * @param maxRedirects
 *   How many redirects to automatically resolve; defaults to 5. You can also set it to 0 to prevent
 *   Requests from resolving redirects for you
 * @param verifySslCerts
 *   Set this to false to ignore problems with SSL certificates
